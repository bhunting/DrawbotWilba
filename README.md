Original Drawbot code from Wilba6582 (Jason Williams).

Presently does not compile under Processing 2.0.

This code supports using an external game controller to move the drawbot.

This code works as shown in video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7J0FbKcCjw

Original code will be the initial commit then future commits will be modifications
to support Processing 2.0.
